            //Hard - code a value for the jackpot amount and let the user know what the jackpot amount is at some point you decide in the program.
            //The program should count the number of correctly guessed numbers and output to the console to notify the user.Example:
            //You guessed 3 numbers correctly!
            //The program should calculate the user's winnings based on the number of numbers guessed correctly.

            //The user's winnings should be output to the console. Example:
            //You won $256, 877.23!

            //PART 4
            //Ask the user if the user would like to play again.
            //If the user says yes, then the program should run again from the beginning.
            //If the user says no, then the program should say "Thanks for playing!"(Must be exact statement).
